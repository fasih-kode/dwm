first, you will need to install X server & git

# pacman -S xorg-xinit xorg git

clone suckless software such as dwm (window manager), st (recommended terminal), and dmenu (simple application menu)

# git clone git://git.suckless.org/dwm
# git clone git://git.suckless.org/st
# git clone git://git.suckless.org/dmenu

change directory into each one, and compile them

$ cd dwm ## do this step also with st and dmenu
# sudo make clean install

$ <favorite text editor> .xinitrc
    from there, add "exec dwm" into the file, save, and exit
